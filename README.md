# 🌟 Hello Android App

A beginner-friendly Android mini project that demonstrates core concepts like activities, intents, layout design, and resource management — all themed around Van Gogh's *Starry Night*.

## 📱 App Overview

The app consists of two screens:

### 1. MainActivity
- Input field for the user's name
- Button to proceed to the quote screen
- Personalized welcome message
- Lifecycle logging (`onCreate`, `onStart`, etc.)

### 2. SecondActivity
- Displays a Van Gogh quote:
  > *"It often seems to me that the night is much more alive and richly colored than the day."*  
  > — followed by the user's name
- Share button to send the quote via other apps (WhatsApp, Gmail, etc.)
- Button to return to the main screen
- Lifecycle logging for educational purposes
